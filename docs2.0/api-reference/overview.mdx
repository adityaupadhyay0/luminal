## Work in Progress

The API reference for Luminal is currently under construction. We are working on generating a comprehensive and easy-to-navigate reference for all the public APIs in the core library and the extension crates.

In the meantime, you can explore the source code on [GitHub](https://github.com/jafioti/luminal) to understand the available modules and functions.

Some of the key crates to look at are:
- [`luminal`](https://github.com/jafioti/luminal/tree/main/src): The core library.
- [`luminal_nn`](https://github.com/jafioti/luminal/tree/main/crates/luminal_nn/src): Common neural network layers.
- [`luminal_training`](https://github.com/jafioti/luminal/tree/main/crates/luminal_training/src): Tools for training models, including autograd and optimizers.

We appreciate your patience as we work to improve the documentation.
